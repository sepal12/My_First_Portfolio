# My First Portfolio

This project is a simple HTML portfolio designed to showcase basic web development skills. 

## Project Structure

- **html_basic/**: This directory contains the main HTML file and the README documentation.
  - **base_index.html**: A basic HTML file that includes a DOCTYPE declaration, a head section with a title, and a body section for content.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide a foundational understanding of HTML structure and to serve as a starting point for further web development projects. 

Feel free to modify the `base_index.html` file to add your own content and styles as you continue to learn and grow in your web development journey.
